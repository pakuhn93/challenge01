## Description

I modified the code of a mock website to fall in-line with the listed specifications:
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

In order to accomplish these goals, I needed to ensure that the website meets accessibility standards by fixing broken links
and refactoring code. The code should now be updated to fit common code practice.
In this project, I learned how to reverse engineer parts of code that I did not understand as well as refactor an already
created mock website to a mock client's specifications.

## Usage

The links in the navigation should all be functioning properly now. They should be going to the content that explains their given name.

## Credits

I worked with Earnest Dawn and Jose Perez in Discord, however, most of the conversations had were mostly about how certain elements and lines
of code worked.
